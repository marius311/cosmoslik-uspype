   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

CosmoSlik Documentation
=======================

*CosmoSlik is a modular Monte Carlo sampler of cosmological likelihoods.*

Quickstart
==========

:ref:`Install <install>` CosmoSlik, then create a file ``params.ini`` containing::

    likelihoods = wmap
    models = camb
    derivers = cosmology
    samplers = metropolis_hastings
    
    logA = 3.1 [2 4 0.1]
    ns = 1 [0 2 0.1]
    theta = 0.0104 [0 1 0.0001]
    tau = 0.09 [0 1 .01]
    ombh2 = .022 [0 1 .001]
    omch2 = .11 [0 1 .01]

    output_file = chain.dat
    samples = 100000
    
Now run::

    ./cosmoslik.py params.ini
    
and you are running a chain for the WMAP likelihood! Now add some other :ref:`modules <modules>` or :ref:`create <create>` your own!
